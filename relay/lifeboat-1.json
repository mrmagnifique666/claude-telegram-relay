  "goal": "Deliver heartbeat notifications to Nicolas about pending emails and code requests",
  "state": "Agent communication bug fixed (commit e1b12ec), Learner agent now uses notes.add instead of telegram.send, system stable with 0 errors for 48h, 4 agents operational",
  "nextAction": "Notify Nicolas via telegram.send about 1 unread email (memU Bot download link) and 1 HIGH priority code request (dashboard files)",
  "constraints": "Must use telegram.send for notifications, must mention sender/subject for emails, must mention count/priority for code requests, chatId=1 admin=false context",
  "unknowns": "Whether dashboard files in sandbox/qplus-website are sufficient or need regeneration, whether scheduler heartbeat should continue trying telegram.send despite context issues",
  "artifacts": "commit e1b12ec, src/agents/definitions/learner.ts, code-requests.json, sandbox/qplus-website/index.html|styles.css|script.js",
  "stopConditions": "If telegram.send continues failing due to context issues, if user requests different notification approach, if priorities change from Moltbook/Business Plan work",
