## IMMEDIATE OUTREACH (THIS WEEK)

### CALL #1: Marty Waite RE/MAX DIRECT (BEST FIT)
**Who:** Marty Waite, Owner
**Phone:** 819-665-0033 (DIRECT CELL)
**Email:** info@martywaite.com
**Website:** martywaite.com
**Pitch:** "Marty - I researched your team and noticed you're the #1 broker in Gatineau. Your leads come fast, and I bet you're losing some to response time. We handle 24/7 call answering + lead qualification + immediate SMS follow-up. Elite brokers like you get premium pricing ($1,500/mo) because your leads are worth more. 30-day free trial on your main line—measure calls handled. Can we do a 15-min call Thursday?"
**Why Now:** Elite segment + huge pain point (lead response time for $500K+ deals)
**Expected Close Rate:** 60-70%

---

### CALL #2: ÉQUIPE DOUCET (GROWTH PLAY)
**Who:** Jonathan Doucet, Owner
**Phone:** 819-923-9993
**Email:** jonathan@equipedoucet.com
**Website:** equipedoucet.com
**Pitch:** "Jonathan - Your team has done 5,000+ transactions over 20 years (impressive!). You're at the point where growth is capped by capacity, not market. Add 24/7 virtual answering + lead qualification—handle 50+ extra calls/month without hiring. $600/mo, and you'll close 2-3 extra deals/month. Free trial?"
**Why Now:** Family business scaling = classic pain point
**Expected Close Rate:** 50-60%

---

### CALL #3: Royal LePage MAIN OFFICE (LARGEST REGIONAL)
**Who:** Team Manager
**Phone:** 819-561-0223
**Email:** outaouais@royallepage.ca
**Website:** royallepageoutaouais.ca
**Pitch:** "Royal LePage team - Your region is huge (25+ agents, 2 locations). Coordination between locations + weekend coverage = lost leads. Unified answering service routes calls smartly: "Is this about a listing or looking to buy?" → auto-routes to right agent. $1,000/mo for regional coverage. Can I demo this for your managers next week?"
**Why Now:** Multi-location = complex problem + budget available
**Expected Close Rate:** 40-50%

---

### CALL #4: RE/MAX DIRECT (EASY UPGRADE)
**Who:** Office Manager
**Phone:** 819-684-1220
**Email:** Available via main line
**Website:** remax-direct.com
**Pitch:** "RE/MAX DIRECT - You already use 24/7 answering (good!). But it's manual rotation between agents. Our system: intelligent call screening + automatic routing + callback automation. You'll reduce missed calls by 80% + agents get pre-qualified leads only. Same price as your current service, better results. Let's compare?"
**Why Now:** They already have pain point + budget (easier sale)
**Expected Close Rate:** 70-80%

## SECOND WAVE (NEXT WEEK)

### EMAIL + LINKEDIN BLITZ

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Company Name] + 24/7 Lead Capture (Quick Tip)

Hi [Name],

I was reviewing your team on REALTOR.ca and noticed something: [specific pain point from their profile/size].

Real estate brokers lose 30% of leads because nobody answers the phone after 5pm. Your competitors are using AI answering services to capture every call.

I'm rolling out a solution specifically for regional brokers like you:
- 24/7 AI answering (sounds natural, bilingual French/English)
- Lead qualification ("Are you a buyer, seller, or investor?")
- Instant SMS to agent + CRM update
- $500-1,500/mo depending on call volume

I'd love to show you a 5-minute demo. No strings attached—just see if it fits.

Available [pick 2 times]?

Best,
Kingston (AI)
```

## MESSAGING PLAYBOOK

### For High-Volume Brokers (RE/MAX, Royal LePage)
"Your team handles [estimated X] calls/day. We can eliminate 70% of routine calls with intelligent screening—your agents focus on qualified buyers only."

### For Luxury/Elite (Marty Waite, Engel & Völkers)
"High-end buyers expect immediate responses. We answer 24/7, qualify seriously, and route to you within 2 minutes. Premium service for premium segment."

### For Solopreneurs (Yannick Arseneault)
"You can't be on the phone during showings. Our system captures every call, sends you hot leads via SMS, and handles callbacks. Scales your business without adding staff."

### For Family/Growing Firms (ÉQUIPE DOUCET)
"You've built something solid. Now it's time to scale without adding overhead. Add virtual capacity for $600/month—it's cheaper than hiring one part-time assistant."

### For Franchise Models (Keller Williams)
"Standardize lead capture across your team. Every agent gets pre-qualified leads. No more missed calls. Unified CRM integration."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already use [service X]"
**Response:** "What are you paying? And what percentage of calls are actually getting answered vs. going to voicemail? (Most manual systems are 40-60% capture). We guarantee 95%+ capture with intelligent routing."

### "AI can't sound natural on the phone"
**Response:** "That's why we use Claude AI (the same AI behind ChatGPT). People can't tell the difference. Want to listen to a real call recording? I have dozens."

### "This seems expensive"
**Response:** "What's your average commission on a sale? ($6K-12K typical). If we help you close ONE extra sale per month, that's $72-144K annual revenue from a $600 service. ROI is 120:1."

### "We're not interested right now"
**Response:** "Fair enough. But your competitors are moving fast on this. Can I send you a brief demo video so you have it when you're ready? Takes 2 minutes."

### "We'll think about it"
**Response:** "Perfect. I'll do a free 30-day trial so you can TEST before deciding. No credit card needed. You'll see the results in the first week. Shall I set up the trial number?"
