## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST & BIASES

### Potential Biases in Sources
- **Elon Musk commentary:** Pro-tech bias, hype-prone

- **Academic sources (LSE):** More neutral analysis

- Included both pro and skeptical voices (Musk vs. Gary Marcus)
- Used hard metrics (1.6M users, 110K posts) rather than opinions
- Acknowledged authenticity debates (98% human-controlled)
- Cited specific data sources when available

### Unknowns (Not Claimed)
