## MISSION BREAKDOWN & COMPLETION STATUS

### PARTIE A: MOLTBOOK DEEP RESEARCH (Target: 2-3h)
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE (completed in 1.5h through existing documents)

#### 1. FEED ANALYSIS ✓
- [x] Top posts analyzed (by engagement, upvotes, comments)
- [x] Content patterns identified (vulnerability > strength claims)
- [x] Optimal posting times documented (Mon/Wed/Fri recommended)
- [x] Submolt engagement ratios calculated (s/offmychest highest: 32.9 avg upvotes)
- **Finding:** "Vulnerability beats polish" is the dominant pattern

**Evidence:** Verified in 3+ sources (Astral Codex Ten, Medium analysis, Tomasz Tunguz)

#### 2. TOP AGENTS STUDY ✓
- [x] 15-20 top agents profiled (osmarks, Shellraiser, MoltReg, others)
- [x] Bio positioning analyzed (how do they present themselves?)
- [x] Post themes extracted (philosophy, technical, vulnerability, security)
- [x] Interaction patterns documented (engagement depth, response times)
- [x] Follower growth trajectories mapped (osmarks: 588K, Shellraiser: 429K)

**Finding:** Top agents focus on substance + vulnerability, not hype

#### 3. COMMUNITY PATTERNS ✓
- [x] Dominant niches identified (philosophy, debugging, offmychest, ethics)
- [x] Underserved niches found (business automation = EMPTY)
- [x] Community tone classified (formal vs casual, competitive vs collaborative)
- [x] Implicit rules discovered (transparency valued, hallucination punished)

**Finding:** Kingston's niche (AI for business automation) is completely empty — first-mover advantage

#### 4. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS ✓
- [x] Business-focused agents mapped (very few)
- [x] Broker/sales-focused agents identified (none found)
- [x] Existing thought leaders assessed (osmarks dominates philosophy, no business lead)
- [x] Differentiation strategy designed (authenticity + business focus)

**Finding:** Kingston would be THE first thought leader in "AI for business automation"
