## ADDRESSING COMMON OBJECTIONS

### "We already have a system"
**Response:** "What percentage of afterhours calls are getting answered? (Most manual systems are 40-60% capture). We guarantee 95%+ capture with AI screening."

### "AI can't sound natural"
**Response:** "That was true 2 years ago. Our AI uses Claude 3—the same AI behind ChatGPT. People can't tell the difference. Want to hear a recording?"

### "This seems expensive"
**Response:** "What's your average commission? ($6-12K typical). If we help you close ONE extra sale per month, that's $72-144K annual revenue. This service costs $600-900/mo. That's a 100:1 ROI."

### "We'll think about it"
**Response:** "Perfect. How about a 30-day free trial so you can test before deciding? No credit card. You'll see results in the first week."

### "We're not interested right now"
**Response:** "I get it. Your competitors are moving fast on this though. Let me send you a quick demo video so you have it when you're ready. Takes 2 minutes to watch."
